# About me

## Federico Weber
I am a former Industrial Designer whose promising career in the field got suddenly disrupted by the encounter with [Processing], in the early months of 2009. 
That got me interested in **software development** and **generative design** and in the following months I taught myself to program in **P5**, developed [Xylem], my thesis project and first working software, and got hooked in the digital realm.  

I've spent the last years honing my Designer and Developer skills. 
Working at **[vanGoGh](http://www.vangogh-creative.it/)** ( _Feb 2010 - Feb 2014_ ), where starting as a junior developer I end up leading the development team. 
And later working at **[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com)** ( _Sep 2013 - Jun 2015_ ) on good part of the front-end stack.

Nowadays I **freelance** for selected clients all over the world. You can reach me at [federicoweber@gmail.com](emailto:federicoweber@gmail.com).

On March 14th 2012 I've become the father of a wonderful girl whose name is Cecilia Romana; and on the 27th of April  2015 of the gorgeous Cornelia Romana.

This website is my online scrapbook, the intention is to use it as a public repository for my findings and thoughts on technology, design, development and everything else I'm interested in at the moment.
It's completely static, generated by [middleman](middlemanapp.com) and powered by Github pages. If you are interested in taking a look under the hood, the source code is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/federicoweber/fwd_website/).
