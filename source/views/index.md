I'm a Designer & Developer living in Milan, Italy. 
In the past years, I've worked at [vanGoGh](http://vangogh-creative.it/) building websites for clients like Adidas, Maserati and Piaggio; and later at [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com). Now I'm **handcrafting** websites & apps for clients all over the world.
