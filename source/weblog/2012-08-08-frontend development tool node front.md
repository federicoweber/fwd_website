I've just discovered [Nodefront](http://karthikv.github.com/nodefront/), a command-line tools, developed by [Karthik Viswanathan](http://karthikv.net), that ease front-end development by compiling and watching **.jade**, **.styl** and **coffeescript** files.

Among the other features it did offer i do find the **live compile** option particularly useful.

If you are curios here is a [screencast](https://vimeo.com/46197434) of it in action
