title: Fine tune your headers typography with SlabText.js

Based on Erik Loyer's [slabtype algorithm](http://erikloyer.com/index.php/blog/the_slabtype_algorithm_part_1_background/) [SlabText](http://www.frequency-decoder.com/demo/slabText/) is a nice jQuery plugin to achieve the popular slab header effect. 
I especially like to be able to manually set word combinations and the possibility to set a break point, to disable the effect, if the view port reach a chosen minimum resolution.

If you are interested in javascript and typography you should also check Paravel's [lettering.js](http://letteringjs.com) to fine tune each single letter of a given text.
