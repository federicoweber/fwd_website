Congratulations to the [Meteor](http://meteor.com/) team for raising such a big sum for an open source project.

For those new with the matter Meteor is an open-source platform for building web apps in javascript. What is differentiating it from the competitors is the availability of the same APIs for both the front-end and the back-end, allowing super fast development.
You should really take a look at the  live updating leaderboard [example](http://meteor.com/examples/leaderboard).
