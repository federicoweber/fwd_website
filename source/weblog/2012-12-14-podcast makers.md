title: The New Disruptors

Hosted by Glenn Fleishman, [The New Disruptors](http://www.muleradio.net/newdisruptors/) is brilliant weekly podcast, on Mule Radio Syndicate, that investigate the new economy of Makers and Crowdfunding.

Unfortunately the audio quality is poor(that was true at the time of writing *12/14/2012* but audio quality of the new episodes is remarkable), but the content is remarkable and the pace is engaging. If you are into self-production you must subscribe to this podcast.
