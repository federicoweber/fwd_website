I didn't notice at first, but also [acrylic got acquired](http://blog.acrylicapps.com/post/27635101056/our-next-project-facebook) yesterday. This time the buyer is Facebook

> Our products and services have not been acquired by Facebook, and while there are **no plans for further development** on them, Wallet and Pulp will continue to remain available for download and purchase in their current form. Weâ€™ll certainly be the first to let you know of any updates or changes here in the future.

So In one day I'we lost future updates for both a great e-mail client and a good password manager.
