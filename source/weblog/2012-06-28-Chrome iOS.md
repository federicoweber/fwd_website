Google have just released Chrome for iOS on the [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/chrome/id535886823).
Unfortunately it's not running on v8, Apple is not allowing that, and it's significatively slower than mobile safari. Still it do pack some interesting features. Like the unified address and search bar, and the synchronization of  current opened tabs between multiple devices.
