Just discovered [fontshop](https://www.fontshop.com/) [Webfonter](https://webfonter.fontshop.com/) Chrome extension. A neat solution to browse and experiment with the shop extensive catalog, directly on the website you are building. Among the various features it supports: *custom CSS selectors* and save the configuration in the *Local Storage*.
