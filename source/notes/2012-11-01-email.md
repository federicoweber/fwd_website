I've recently have a discussion with my colleagues about my "weird" use of email and instant messaging services.

Emails are great, and can be extremely powerful, but there are some common believes and bad practices that lead to an awful fruition experience.

## The inbox is not my to-do list
Some of my colleagues or client believe that my inbox is a special kind of to-do list to which they can freely append tasks, often urgent ones, and they get quite annoyed when they realize that I do not act immediately upon those. 
This is not only pretentious, but also highly unproductive. The fact is that  I considered email an asynchronous medium, therefore I muted almost any kind of notification[^1] from my inbox, and only check them once every couple of hours or more.

## Why subject matter

## Interleaved replies

## Wise use of the attachments 

## Final Thoughts on signature

[^1]: I'm also using an IFTTT rules to notify me via SMS if an email with URGET in the subject happen to land on my inbox
