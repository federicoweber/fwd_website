title: An OpenType hack to design simple graphs
---

Designed by [@traviskochel](https://twitter.com/traviskochel) [FF Chartwell] is a smart font hack that leverage the OpenType features to convert numbers into graphs.
The process of creating a graph with Chartwell is as simple as turning on the *Stylistic Alternates*. By doing so a series of, plus separated, numbers are converted into the corresponding graph.

It's possible to create the following type of graphs: bars vertical, bars horizontal, lines, pies, radar, rings, rose.

The font is quite useful as it is and the guys at [FontFont](https://www.fontfont.com/) are already working on a web version of it.
