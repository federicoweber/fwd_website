When I first hear about [Baraka], almost 5 years ago, I was quite skeptical about it—96 minutes of photographs and music is not something to take lightly—but while watching it I was mesmerized by the experience and beauty of the images. And at today I still consider it one of my favorites movies of all the times.

[Samsara](http://www.barakasamsara.com), also directed by Ron Fricke and  produced by Mark Magidson, expand the themes developed in [Baraka] and take us on an extraordinary trip around the world  showing "*the ever turning wheel of life*". 
The movie have been shoot for almost five years on something like one hundred of location, spanned across twenty-five countries, and have been photographed entirely in 70mm film using a custom build motion control time-lapse camera.
