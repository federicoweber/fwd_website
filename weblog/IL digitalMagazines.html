        <p>This morning I was looking at twitter feed and I did stumbled upon a tweet from <a href="The current art director of the  IL magazine">Francesco Franchi</a>, announcing that the <strong>IL</strong> magazine is finally on the iPad Newsstand and that the current issue it's available for download.
        Being a long time supporter<sup id="fnref:collecting"><a href="#fn:collecting" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, I was more than excited about it, imagining the incredible things the staff have pulled out leveraging the possibilities offered by the iPad—Especially considering the intensive use of info-graphics the magazine do, that lead them to won a more than rewarding list of awards, including a <em>Compasso D'oro</em>—. And I decided to welcomely spend the increased price<sup id="fnref:price"><a href="#fn:price" class="footnote">2</a></sup> to enjoy the experience of reading it on my iPad.</p>
        
        <p><img alt="IL August cover on the iPad" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/116832/federicoweber.com/Photo%2023-08-12%2013%2017%2014.png" /></p>
        
        <p>Unfortunately the magazine is not only far for great—not featuring any interactive content—but it' completely awful. Residing in that terrible editorial space defined by those magazine that, in order to quickly get to the iPad, are presented as a collection of static images and neither went through the effort of adapting the content to the different ration of the layout.</p>
        
        <p>This was bad enough when the first iPad magazines comes out, almost two years ago. But if an awarded magazine like <strong>IL</strong> pull out something so poor in quality, and charge a premium price for it, I do fell steamed.</p>
        
        <p><img alt="poor pages alignment" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/116832/federicoweber.com/Photo%2023-08-12%2014%2003%2007.png?w=1f396c19" /></p>
        
        <p>I do really want to read the current issue properly, so right now I'm heading to the nearest newsagent to buy a paper version of the magazine, and i suggest you to do the same. Or better completely skip the digital one if you haven't bought it yet.</p>
        
        <p>For the future I will patiently wait for a proper digital edition that I'm sure <em>Il Sole 24 Ore</em> have the expertise—being also the publisher of the nice and free iPad magazine <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/it/app/la-vita-nova/id395924638?mt=8">la vita nòva</a>— and the willingness to craft for us.</p>
