        &gt; Sparrow did everything right. They built an incredible email app with broad appeal and released it into the hottest software market the world has ever seen. And yet it was a financial flop.</p>
        
        <p>After a comparison based on App Store ranking and it's own experience selling Launch Center Pro, David made the point on why the Sparrow team, who had to repay for investments, had to sell to google to keep the team going.</p>
        
        <p>One of the main point on the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4283307">HackerNews</a> discussion is that they should have adopted a <strong>recurring revenue model</strong>.
        I do think that what they did tried with the yearly subscription <a href="http://blog.sparrowmailapp.com/post/23034702297/sparrowiphone12">proposal</a> for the push notification was an attempt to steer in that direction. But as it turned out it wasn't such a <a href="http://www.macgasm.net/2012/05/16/ask-and-tell-sparrows-subscription-plan-for-push-services-not-a-popular-idea/">popular</a> move.</p>
