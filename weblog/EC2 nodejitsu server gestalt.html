        <p>Last year I decided to renew my website, and cause I was also studying Node.js I decided to develop from scratch the publishing platform—you can read more about it in <a href="http://federicoweber.com/gestaltapp/20120625-142551-pi-3-introducinggestalt">here</a>—and self host it on Amazon EC2 to get a grip on the platform.</p>
        
        <p>As my first attempt to self manage a server, setting up the EC2 instance was far from an easy task for me. It took me a couple of days of studying official documentation and tutorials to successfully setup the EC2 instance, deploy Gestalt via GIT and have the server run it as a demon.</p>
        
        <p>During this time, while Gestalt grown in capabilities and performance, I discovered myself to be a terrible SisAdmin. Therefor when I received the notification that my free tier<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> was about to expire I quickly decided to migrate everything to a managed platform where my only concern would bee to work on the Gestalt.</p>
        
        <p>Looking for the perfect match for my needs I decided to give a try at <a href="http://nodejitsu.com/paas.html">Nodejitsu's Platform as a Service</a> (Paas)—being attracted from their convenient fees, with the cheapest plan, for individuals, starting at $3 a month. 
        Prepared for a long and painful migration I created an account studied their documentation, installed jitsu CLI via npm and in <strong>less then 10 minutes</strong> Gestalt was running smoothly from their servers. Once I've been sure that everything was stable I update the DNS records and shutted down  the EC2 instance.</p>
        
        <p>It's early for me to comment on their service reliability, but with such a pleasant startup I can not help but recommend their service.</p>
