          <p>Recently there have been a lot of disillusionment about a series of successfully backed Kickstarter projects who failed to ship. Therefor Kickstarter decide to <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/kickstarter-is-not-a-store">clarify</a> their position and enforce a new series of rules especially targeted to physical product.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>It&rsquo;s hard to know how many people feel like they&rsquo;re shopping at a store when they&rsquo;re backing projects on Kickstarter, but we want to make sure that it&rsquo;s no one. Today we&rsquo;re introducing a number of changes to reinforce that Kickstarter isn’t a store.</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>While the <strong>Risks and Challenges</strong> section is a correct move, I have mixed feelings about the new measures for Hardware and Product Design projects. Surely demanding a working prototype is a step in the right direction, but completely prohibit the 3D rendering is a poor choice. And neither of this help backers to understand if the product they are going to support can be realistically manufactured. </p>
          
          <h2>Working prototype</h2>
          
          <p>A working prototype is a necessary step for the creators to figure out how o produce a real product out of their amazing concept. But it&rsquo;s not enough to assure the backers that it&rsquo;s actually possible produce the same product in large quantity, leveraging industrial facilities, neither it&rsquo;s a good estimation of the real production costs—which can also vary by a significant amount based on the number of peaces that are going to be manufactured.</p>
          
          <p>Especially for complicated products that require a combination of different technologies and draconian manufacturing and distribution lines<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. </p>
          
          <h2>Renderings and simulations</h2>
          
          <p>The case against rendering is a complete non sense to me. Simulations and renderings are powerful tools for creators both to  design and iterate the product and to show the backers what the product it&rsquo;s going to look like and the possible colors and trim customizations.</p>
          
          <h2>Is founding cap an option?</h2>
          
          <p>An interesting point Kickstarter raise in their post is to fix to one the amount of quantities that a project can offer to a single backer.</p>
          
          <blockquote>
          <p>Offering multiple quantities of a reward is prohibited. Hardware and Product Design projects can only offer rewards in single quantities or a sensible set</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <p>This kind of choice make sense considering that over a certain amount of product to produce it could become necessary to reconsider the entire manufacturing line—that could not be convenient probably till a new order of magnitude is reached—and keep manufacturing the product using a line produced for smaller quantity is not always possible or desirable.</p>
          
          <p>This kind of consideration also open the road to another possibility, a founding cap. Clearly this is not something Kickstarter should force to the product, most of the projects founded don&rsquo;t have real issues with over founding, but could be a nice option that the creators can decide to adopt.</p>
          
          <p>Even better would be to have <strong>progressive founding goals</strong>; it&rsquo;s quite a common practice, for creators, to promise increased sets of features based on the amount of money (over the initial founding goal) the project manage to raise<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Kickstarter could officially support this kind of initiative by charging late bakers only when the next goal is reached.</p>
