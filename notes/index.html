                  <p>Last year I decided to renew my website, and cause I was also studying Node.js I decided to develop from scratch the publishing platform—you can read more about it in <a href="http://federicoweber.com/gestaltapp/20120625-142551-pi-3-introducinggestalt">here</a>—and self host it on Amazon EC2 to get a grip on the platform. </p>
                  
                  <p>As my first attempt to self manage a server, setting up the EC2 instance was far from an easy task for me. It took me a couple of days of studying official documentation and tutorials to successfully setup the EC2 instance, deploy Gestalt via GIT and have the server run it as a demon. </p>
                  
                  <p>During this time, while Gestalt grown in capabilities and performance, I discovered myself to be a terrible SisAdmin. Therefor when I received the notification that my free tier<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> was about to expire I quickly decided to migrate everything to a managed platform where my only concern would bee to work on the Gestalt.</p>
                  
                  <p>Looking for the perfect match for my needs I decided to give a try at <a href="http://nodejitsu.com/paas.html">Nodejitsu&rsquo;s Platform as a Service</a> (Paas)—being attracted from their convenient fees, with the cheapest plan, for individuals, starting at $3 a month. 
                  Prepared for a long and painful migration I created an account studied their documentation, installed jitsu CLI via npm and in <strong>less then 10 minutes</strong> Gestalt was running smoothly from their servers. Once I&rsquo;ve been sure that everything was stable I update the DNS records and shutted down  the EC2 instance.</p>
                  
                  <p>It&rsquo;s early for me to comment on their service reliability, but with such a pleasant startup I can not help but recommend their service.</p>
                  
                  <p>During this time (from February 28 2012) I&rsquo;ve been able to use their services for free leveraging the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/free/faqs/">Free Tier Period</a> </p>

                  <h2>The art of wet shaving</h2>
                  
                  <p>My father taught me to shave with a Bic disposable razor and canned foam when I was 14; and for my 16th birthday I received as a present from Gillette, a free Mac3<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> that become my shaving razor for almost a decade.
                  The experience of shaving with it was far from ideal, my neck used to be filled with ingrown hairs and razors burns and I grow up believing that I&rsquo;ve been cursed with a delicate skin.</p>
                  
                  <h3>Electric shaving</h3>
                  
                  <p>For Christmas of 2008 my parents gifted me an electric shaver, a shining multi-purpose Braun Cruzer3. As awesome as it look this shaver can be really useful for trimming and refining intricate beard styles but, being almost beardless, I used that to completely shave myself. 
                  The shaving experience with the Cruzer3 have been, if possible, even worst. I&rsquo;ve kept using it for almost six months, hoping that my beard will adapt, before giving up.</p>
                  
                  <h3>More blades are better</h3>
                  
                  <p>On that time I decide that my old Mac3 already got enough miles and I bought a Gillette Fusion<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and switched to shaving gel in place of the canned foam.</p>
                  
                  <p>I must admit that the overall shaving experience improved quite a bit, but the shaving costs grown out of control. 
                  To prevent razor burns I had to replace the shaving head every two week, and with a costs of €4,50 each, my beard used to cost me almost €100 a year in blades.</p>
                  
                  <h3>Shaved by a professional</h3>
                  
                  <p>On october of 2011 my wife got pregnant and we decided to move to a proper<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> apartment in the city center. On the new neighborhood we discovered a small barber shop whose owner, a gentle man from Naples on its 70&rsquo;s, use to provide old manner shaving service with a Shavette razor<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, pre-shave balm and hand mounted foam.
                  That have been by far one of the best shaving experience at that point, and settled the benchmark for all of the following ones.
                  The shaving foam was soft and warm and the razor glided over my tightened skin producing a resolute sound while trimming the whiskers. The result was a smooth and relaxed face on which the beard refused to grown back for the following three days.</p>
                  
                  <h3>The Straight Razor</h3>
                  
                  <p>After that experience I&rsquo;ve grown interested in Straight Razors<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>, and with my great pleasure, my Father in Law, in accord with my Wife, gave me as a present, for my 29th birthday, a huge 7/8 Straight Razor from Filarmonica<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> and a leather strop.
                  My first shave with that razor was a mess, I recursively cutted my self badly, and my skin was so sore that I&rsquo;ve been not able to shave for almost a week. 
                  The experience was so bad that I almost give up, but the memories of that one amazing shave I got in that small barber shop in Milan persuaded me to endure on the path. </p>
                  
                  <h3>Going pro</h3>
                  
                  <p>After that first terrible shave it&rsquo;s passed almost one year. In this time  I bought a smaller, shave-ready, razor(5/8 roundpoint Astrale from Dovo); learned how to prepare my face, lather the shaving cream; and take care of my razor.</p>
                  
                  <p>Now days razors burns and ingrown hairs are distant nightmare, I rarely cut myself and I&rsquo;m able to achieve a wonderful shave that is almost on par with the one I got in that barber shop. But more important than that is the transformation of a painful daily routine in an awesome ritual that I enjoy twice a week and I&rsquo;m on a long life path to hone my skills in the art of pogonotomy.</p>
