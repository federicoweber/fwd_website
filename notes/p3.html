                  <p>This morning I was looking at twitter feed and I did stumbled upon a tweet from [Francesco Franchi]<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, announcing that the <strong>IL</strong> magazine is finally on the iPad Newsstand and that the current issue it&rsquo;s available for download.
                  Being a long time supporter<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, I was more than excited about it, imagining the incredible things the staff have pulled out leveraging the possibilities offered by the iPad—Especially considering the intensive use of info-graphics the magazine do, that lead them to won a more than rewarding list of awards, including a <em>Compasso D&#39;oro</em>—. And I decided to welcomely spend the increased price<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> to enjoy the experience of reading it on my iPad.</p>
                  
                  <p><img alt="IL August cover on the iPad" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/116832/federicoweber.com/Photo%2023-08-12%2013%2017%2014.png" /></p>
                  
                  <p>Unfortunately the magazine is not only far for great—not featuring any interactive content—but it&rsquo; completely awful. Residing in that terrible editorial space defined by those magazine that, in order to quickly get to the iPad, are presented as a collection of static images and neither went through the effort of adapting the content to the different ration of the layout.</p>
                  
                  <p>This was bad enough when the first iPad magazines comes out, almost two years ago. But if an awarded magazine like <strong>IL</strong> pull out something so poor in quality, and charge a premium price for it, I do fell steamed.</p>
                  
                  <p><img alt="poor pages alignment" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/116832/federicoweber.com/Photo%2023-08-12%2014%2003%2007.png?w=1f396c19" /></p>
                  
                  <p>I do really want to read the current issue properly, so right now I&rsquo;m heading to the nearest newsagent to buy a paper version of the magazine, and i suggest you to do the same. Or better completely skip the digital one if you haven&rsquo;t bought it yet.</p>
                  
                  <p>For the future I will patiently wait for a proper digital edition that I&rsquo;m sure <em>Il Sole 24 Ore</em> have the expertise—being also the publisher of the nice and free iPad magazine <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/it/app/la-vita-nova/id395924638?mt=8">la vita nòva</a>— and the willingness to craft for us.</p>
                  
                  <p><img alt="rane" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/116832/federicoweber.com/Photo%2023-08-12%2013%2018%2010.png?w=750ef65b" /></p>
                  
                  <p>The current art director of the  IL magazine</p>
                  
                  <p>I&rsquo;m regularly collecting the IL magazine since 2009, and I&rsquo;ve always been pleased by it&rsquo;s content quality and it&rsquo;s extraordinary visual appeal.</p>
                  
                  <p>The regular price, for the paper edition, is € 2,00 if you buy it with <em>Il Sole 24 Ore</em>, the day it is published, or € 0,50 from the day after. The price for the iPad version is € 2,39.</p>

                  <p>Yesterday, <a href="https://twitter.com/sippey">Michael Sippey</a>, the Director of consumer product at Twitter, <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api">announced</a> some obscure changes in the upcoming v1.1 of the Twitter API.
                  The majority of which is related to limit the API availability to third party clients.</p>
                  
                  <h2>The dusk of the platform</h2>
                  
                  <p>What was great about Twitter was it’s openness, simplicity, and it’s reliability<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.
                  But right now, in order to be independent, Twitter have to make money. And in the process of reshaping the company they figured out that, to be appealing for advertisers, they have to control the entire user experience, becoming the endpoint of the discussion and not just the vector. They need to be sure that the advertisement they sell will arrive to the users and they can achieve this only with a strict control on what their users see. They decided to do so by prohibiting new third party clients.</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                  <p>Nearly eighteen months ago, we gave developers guidance that they should not build client apps that mimic or reproduce the mainstream Twitter consumer client experience. </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>As far as there is an existing Twitter interface for that specific platform. In fact Twitter is still welcoming to <em>officially approved</em>, native mobile client.</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                  <p>With v1.1 we will require developers that are building client applications that are pre-installed on mobile handsets, SIM cards, chipsets or other consumer electronics devices to have their application certified by Twitter.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>By making the old ones choke in their user base</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                  <p>if you are building a Twitter client application that is accessing the home timeline, account settings or direct messages API endpoints (typically used by traditional client applications) or are using our User Streams product, you will need our permission if your application will require more than 100,000 individual user tokens.</p>
                  
                  <p>We will not be shutting down client applications that use those endpoints and are currently over those token limits. If your application already has more than 100,000 individual user tokens, you&rsquo;ll be able to maintain and add new users to your application until you reach 200% of your current user token count (as of today) — as long as you comply with our Rules of the Road. Once you reach 200% of your current user token count, you&rsquo;ll be able to maintain your application to serve your users, but you will not be able to add additional users without our permission.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>And by prohibiting integration with different social networks</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                  <p>No other social or 3rd party actions may be attached to a Tweet. </p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <h2>The dawn of the apps</h2>
                  
                  <p>I consider myself more a Tweetbot user than a Twitter user, and I do believe that like me many other users are more tightened to the apps they do use daily to interact with twitter than with the platform itself. 
                  I would like to see what will happen if those apps implement support for other similar platforms <sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. I will surely appreciate.</p>
                  
                  <p>The lightweight structure of the tweet data, make it extremely fast to load even on congested or slow network.</p>
                  
                  <p><a href="http://app.net">App.net</a> got founded in the last days, the alpha version is running and it&rsquo;s more than a valid candidate.</p>

                  The process of creating a graph with Chartwell is as simple as turning on the <em>Stylistic Alternates</em>. By doing so a series of, plus separated, numbers are converted into the corresponding graph.</p>

                  <p>It&rsquo;s possible to create the following type of graphs: bars vertical, bars horizontal, lines, pies, radar, rings, rose.</p>
                  
                  <p>The font is quite useful as it is and the guys at <a href="https://www.fontfont.com/">FontFont</a> are already working on a web version of it.</p>

                  <p>In a recent post, <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/07/26/mac-app-store-future"><em>The Mac App Store’s future of irrelevance</em></a> , Marco Arment make some points on the actual state of App Store, and it&rsquo;s possible future.</p>
                  
                  <p><a href="@marcoarment">Marco Arment</a>:</p>
                  
                  <blockquote>
                  <p>But now, I’ve lost all confidence that the apps I buy in the App Store today will still be there next month or next year. The advantages of buying from the App Store are mostly gone now. My confidence in the App Store, as a customer, has evaporated.</p>
                  
                  <p>The Mac App Store is in significant danger of becoming an irrelevant, low-traffic flea market where buyers rarely venture for serious purchases. And I bet that’s not what Apple had in mind at all.</p>
                  </blockquote>
                  
                  <p>I believe Marco is somehow right, and unluckily for some kind of apps the best option is to buy them outside of the app store. 
                  As of today the App Store, and the Gatekeeper are far from perfect and the impossibility for a developer properly market, updates and discounts. Combined with the strict sandboxing is a great obstacle for an everlasting and healthy adoption both for users and developers. </p>
                  
                  <p>Yet  I do think the App Store is still a far superior shopping experience. In fact, it&rsquo;s so delightful that, many of us bought the same software twice, once the App Store came out, just to have it connected to it, and relieving the pain of dealing with licenses and updates.</p>
                  
                  <p>But Apple can easily fix that. For example they could grant certified developers the rights to both, use iClouds APIs and sell, on the App Store, non sandboxed apps. They can achieve this by properly marking the app and, maybe, <em>hiding</em> it beyond an option in the Security and Privacy settings. By doing so the will ensure the security of the App Store, but also allow those of us who are willing, or need to, use non sandboxed apps to leverage it&rsquo;s power and simplicity.</p>
                  
                  <p>Also I do believe that on the long run, as it&rsquo;s happing on the iOS, the terms and conditions, for an app to be considered sandboxed, will get more flexible. Allowing more of them to jump in.</p>

                  <p>Congratulations to the <a href="http://meteor.com/">Meteor</a> team for raising such a big sum for an open source project.</p>
                  
                  <p>For those new with the matter Meteor is an open-source platform for building web apps in javascript. What is differentiating it from the competitors is the availability of the same APIs for both the front-end and the back-end, allowing super fast development.
                  You should really take a look at the  live updating leaderboard <a href="http://meteor.com/examples/leaderboard">example</a>.</p>
