        <p>When I stumbled upon <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts">Drafts</a>, by Agile Tortoise, I dediced to use it as my mobile note taking app. My choise was dictated by three main reasons:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>it's among the fastest writing app on iOS, ready to write as soon as you start it</li>
          <li>it support textExpander</li>
          <li>it can save the entries to dropbox</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="integrate-it-in-the-overall-workflow">Integrate it in the overall workflow</h2>
        <p>The only problem was to integrate it within my workflow.
        On the mac I am an <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/">nvAlt</a> user and I'm also using a strict naming convention for my files.
        More or less all my notes files names look like this <strong>20120628-193211-NT-0-tag</strong>, where the third element <em>NT</em> is the type of the file, in this case a <em>note</em>. Unfortunately drafts did not allow me to specify the file name and it can only save the file on the sandboxed <em>/Apps/Drafts</em> folder inside dropbox.</p>
        
        <h2 id="hazel-comes-to-rescue">Hazel comes to rescue</h2>
        <p>I did fixed that with the help of <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a>, <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> and a little bit of appleScript.</p>
        
        <p>The file name problem is solved using the first paragraph of the note to write it down, the date is included thanks to TextExpander.</p>
        
        <p>Then on the mac i do have an hazel rule that watch the file content for the notes related tokens, run an appleScipt on it and finally move the files to my main notes folder.

        <p>Here is the script. I think it can be done better, but I've just started learning appleScript.</p>
        
        <pre><code>-- This script is meant to be executed from Hazel
